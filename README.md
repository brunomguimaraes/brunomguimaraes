### Hi there 👋

I'm a highly motivated, hands-on fullstack developer and an advocate for agile methodologies, transparency and collaboration among customers, product managers, software developers, and stakeholders. 

I believe that the combination of agile methodologies and increased transparency can help organizations build highly efficient and successful teams that are capable of creating products and solutions that customers love.
